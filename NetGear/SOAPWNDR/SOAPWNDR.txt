Mitigation:
----
* Ensure remote / WAN management is disabled on the affected devices.
* Only allow trusted devices access to the local network.

Notes:
----
* These vulnerabilities can be leveraged "externally" over the internet,
but require devices to have remote / WAN management enabled.

* Due to the location of this issue (net-cgi) this vulnerability may be
present in other devices and firmware revisions not listed in this
document.

* In the absence of a known security contact these issues were reported
to NetGear support. The initial response from NetGear support was that
despite these issues "the network should still stay secure" due to a
number of built-in security features. Attempts to clarify the nature of
this vulnerability with support were unsuccessful. This ticket has since
been auto-closed while waiting for a follow up. A subsequent email sent
to the NetGear 'OpenSource' contact has also gone unanswered.

* If you have a NetGear device that is believed to be affected and can
confirm whether the PoC works successfully, please let me know and I
will update the copy of this document on GitHub (see below) and provide
credit for your findings.

----
"Genie" SOAP Service
----

A number of NetGear WNDR devices contain an embedded SOAP service that
is seemingly for use with the NetGear Genie application. This service
allows for viewing and setting of certain router parameters, such as:

 * WLAN credentials and SSIDs.
 * Connected clients.
 * Guest WLAN credentials and SSIDs.
 * Parental control settings.

At first glance, this service appears to be filtered and authenticated;
HTTP requests with a `SOAPAction` header set but without a session
identifier will yield a HTTP 401 error. However, a HTTP request with a
blank form and a `SOAPAction` header is sufficient to execute certain
requests and query information from the device.

As this SOAP service is implemented by the built-in HTTP / CGI daemon,
unauthenticated queries will also be answered over the internet if
remote management has been enabled on the device. As a result, affected
devices can be interrogated and hijacked with as little as a well placed
HTTP query.

The attached proof of concept uses this service in order to extract the
administrator password, device serial number, WLAN details, and various
details regarding clients currently connected to the device.

A copy of this document, as well as the proof of concept below and a
more detailed write-up has been made available via GitHub:
